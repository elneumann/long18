            <h2>Teaching the "Long" 18th Century - A Conversation & Resources</h2>
            <p>
                This roundtable brought together scholars from a broad array of geographical foci and institutional perspectives who have been at the forefront of efforts to rethink approaches to thinking, researching, and, crucially, teaching the art and material culture of an interconnected “long” eighteenth century.  voices in museums, plantation sites, and public squares. Participants were invited to anchor short presentations by way of a salient episode: a syllabus, a course session, an assignment, or a digital project. The objective was not to achieve a comprehensive account of the varied perspectives and approaches; instead, we look at this roundtable as part of many such discussions that are already taking place and that will continue in the future We questioned the stakes of a “long” eighteenth century from different vantage points as we account for the histories of colonialism, enslavement, and extraction of bodies and lands, objects and knowledge. And, crucially, we asked how our inquiry shifts when we think from our pedagogical sites. So how have our colleagues approached the “long” and “broad” eighteenth century in their classrooms and research clusters?
