            <h2>Teaching the "Long" 18th Century - A Conversation & Resources</h2>
            <p>
                This roundtable brought together scholars from a broad array of geographical foci and institutional perspectives who have been at the forefront of efforts to rethink approaches to thinking, researching, and, crucially, teaching the art and material culture of an interconnected “long” eighteenth century. The aim was to reflect upon teaching in light of renewed debates on the reparation of objects, revision of histories, and inclusion of colonized and enslaved voices in museums, plantation sites, and public squares. We questioned the stakes of a “long” eighteenth century from different vantage points as we account for the histories of colonialism, enslavement, and extraction of bodies and lands, objects and knowledge. And, crucially, we asked how our inquiry shifts when we think from our pedagogical sites. We were keen to bring into our orbit innovative pedagogical practices because we believe that pedagogy is a core intellectual project, and because it has real ramifications for the future of our discipline. So how have we approached the “long” and “broad” eighteenth century in our classrooms and research clusters?

                Participants were invited to anchor their short presentations by way of a salient episode: a syllabus, a course session, an assignment, or a digital project. The objective was not to achieve a comprehensive account of the varied perspectives and approaches; instead, we look at this roundtable as part of many such discussions that are already taking place and that will continue in the future. Our pedagogical sites, the animating force for this discussion, have manifested on our Zoom screens during a period that has seen the brutal violence and deaths of individuals reverberate globally, from renewed calls for racial justice following George Floyd’s murder in Minneapolis, Minnesota, to the devastation wrought by the COVID-19 pandemic. Through the past year we have often inhabited, and continue to inhabit, non-intersecting physical spaces, disparate temporal realities, desperate emergencies, burdening limitations, unseen disabilities, and variously exhausted bodies. All of our speakers in their pedagogical work bring the ethics of care and justice at its core which inspires us, and we hope it will inspire you.
