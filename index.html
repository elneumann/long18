            <h2>Teaching the "Long" 18th Century - A Conversation & Resources</h2>
            <p>
                This roundtable brought together scholars from a broad array of geographical foci and institutional perspectives who have been at the forefront of efforts to rethink approaches to thinking, researching, and, crucially, teaching the art and material culture of an interconnected “long” eighteenth century. Participants were invited to anchor short presentations by way of a salient episode: a syllabus, a course session, an assignment, or a digital project. Understanding that it is not  possible to capture in any one event a comprehensive account of the myriad perspectives and approaches being developed by our colleagues, we envision this roundtable as one of many such discussions that are taking place and that will continue to transform approaches to research and teaching in the future. At the forefront of our interests was to explore how the stakes of a “long” eighteenth century come into focus or shift when considered from different vantage points, and particularly as we account for the histories of colonialism, enslavement, and extraction of bodies and lands, objects and knowledge. How is our inquiry transformed when we think outward from our pedagogical practices? We invite you to learn more about how our colleagues have approached the “long” and “broad” eighteenth century in their classrooms and research clusters in what follows.

            <h3>
                Interloping & Looking Forward
            </h3>
            <p>
                Together these presentations stake a claim for the varied pedagogies required by and for teaching the “long” eighteenth century:from the object-centered approaches taken by Arabindan-Kesson and Meier to the focus on local temporalities proposed by Whiteman; and from the comparative approach championed by Barker to the collaborative and non-hierarchical methods demonstrated by Avcıoğlu, Cohen-Aponte, and Um. 
            </p>
            <p>
                If we consider the question of periodization relative to our pedagogical practices, answers begin to emerge from these case studies. Strikingly, none of the participants explicitly framed their episode within the “long” eighteenth century. Meier’s seminar explored the macrocosm of the Indian Ocean through a micro focus on materiality, while Cohen-Aponte’s community-based project was part of her sweeping survey of Latin American art. Some participants even referred to themselves as interlopers given that their own research is primarily focused on different periods. Though Whiteman did refocus his year-long course from the Early Modern period to what is effectively the “long” eighteenth century in China, he does not employ that terminology in his own classroom. The shift not only allowed him to focus on the problems to which he was drawn, but directed his students’ attention to what he considered to be most salient in the context of the course.

                Nearly every educator had to make the leap when Zoom replaced their physical classroom during the COVID-19 pandemic. While travel was disrupted this year, technology allowed for the inclusion of voices that may not have otherwise been possible. Meier, for instance, invited multiple guest lecturers to her class via Zoom, such as Nancy Um and Athman Hussein Athman, Keeper of Heritage at the National Museums of Kenya, Mombasa. Online resources, including those from institutions such as the Open University that were already set up for distance learning, took on added importance. This difficult moment has, nonetheless, presented an opportunity moving forward to not just teach with digital technologies, but to embrace digital humanities. The term has been variously <a href="https://whatisdigitalhumanities.com/">defined</a>, but Um’s interactive mapping project offers a clear illustration. Sharing space, whether through collaborative teaching or guest speakers, decenters the single authoritative voice and invites the multiplicity and complexity brought by the addition of new voices.
            </p>
            <p> 
                One implication of the assembled cases is that in the classroom, the conceptual utility of the “long eighteenth century” – or perhaps even the “eighteenth century” tout court –  becomes more attenuated as it extends in length and breadth, in time and across place.  
            </p>
            <p>
                Many of the roundtable speakers reaffirmed the vitality of new approaches to eighteenth-century materials and artefacts activated through the reciprocal processes of teaching and learning. Even though for her it was a familiar topic, Avcıoğlu approached the subject of turquerie anew, and framed the work of scholarly interpretation as a living process by way of her seminar design. Um learned to use Leaflet, a JavaScript Library for interactive web maps, so that she could simultaneously teach her graduate students and inform her own research. These accounts attest that experimentation within the classroom has the capacity to inform our research questions and methods.
            </p>
            <p>
                At the same time, if students are engaged through intentional and critical pedagogies, they become active participants in their own education. Cohen-Aponte emphasizes the need to respond to the fact that students are more  <a href="https://nces.ed.gov/programs/coe/indicator/cha">racially and ethnically diverse</a> than ever, and suggested that there is much to learn from pedagogical literature, even if it is largely targeted to K-12 educators. Approaching research and teaching as dialogical processes, as vividly demonstrated in Arabindan-Kesson’s work with her students on the Art Hx website, presents an opportunity to learn from the diverse, contemporary perspectives that students will inevitably bring to eighteenth-century material and to reconfigure the traditional structures of power and stories of art narrated within the academy.

                The roundtable held on April 23, 2022, as a Zoom webinar was made possible thanks to funding from the Institute of the Humanities and Global Cultures (IHGC) at the University of Virginia. We would like to thank IHGC Interim Director Bruce Holsinger for his support and for his introduction. Thanks are also due to the IHGC team: Anne Gilliam, Caroline Whitcomb, and Joseph Wei. We thank Victoria Valdes, for her monumental post-production video efforts.

                The digital presentation of the roundtable is the product of a collaboration between Sarah Betzer, Dipti Khera, Eleanore Neumann, and Shane Lin, senior developer in the Scholars’ Lab at the University of Virginia. The site was designed by Shane Lin and Eleanore Neumann in July 2021. We are indebted to Shane for his generosity and creativity as a collaborator. Special thanks go to Jennifer Henel for her indispensable advice on developing this digital feature and to Hannah Williams for her guidance throughout the process.
