            <h2>Teaching the "Long" 18th Century - A Conversation & Resources</h2>
            <p>
                This roundtable brought together scholars from a broad array of geographical foci and institutional perspectives who have been at the forefront of efforts to rethink approaches to thinking, researching, and, crucially, teaching the art and material culture of an interconnected “long” eighteenth century. Participants were invited to anchor short presentations by way of a salient episode: a syllabus, a course session, an assignment, or a digital project. The objective was not to achieve a comprehensive account of the varied perspectives and approaches; instead, we look at this roundtable as part of many such discussions that are already taking place and that will continue in the future We questioned the stakes of a “long” eighteenth century from different vantage points as we account for the histories of colonialism, enslavement, and extraction of bodies and lands, objects and knowledge. And, crucially, we asked how our inquiry shifts when we think from our pedagogical sites. So how have our colleagues approached the “long” and “broad” eighteenth century in their classrooms and research clusters?

            <h3>
                Conclusions
            </h3>
            <p>
                Together these presentations stake a claim for the varied pedagogies required by and for teaching the “long” eighteenth century. Each innovative digital project, textbook, or syllabus designed by one of the roundtable participants demonstrates a different yet equally effective strategy for engaging students. From the object-centered approaches taken by Anna Arabindon-Kesson and Prita Meier to the focus on local temporalities proposed by Stephen Whiteman; and from the comparative approach championed by Emma Barker to the collaborative and non-hierarchical methods demonstrated by Nebahat Avcıoğlu, Ananda Cohen-Aponte, and Nancy Um. 
            </p>
            <p>
                If we consider the question of periodization relative to our pedagogical sites, answers begin to emerge from these case studies. None of the participants explicitly framed their episode within the “long” eighteenth century. Meier taught a seminar that explored the macrocosm of the Indian Ocean through a micro focus on materiality, while Cohen-Aponte’s community-based project was part of her sweeping survey of Latin American art. Some even referred to themselves as interlopers given that their own research is primarily focused on different periods. This suggests that, in the classroom, the “long” part of the eighteenth century is particularly difficult to delimit as it extends further and connects more with other times and places. Following Arabindon-Kesson’s provocation, we could instead start with the objects and see with them in order to envision new futures of relation.
            </p>
            <p>
                Though Whiteman did refocus his year-long course from the Early Modern   period to what is effectively the “long” eighteenth century in China, he clarified that he does not employ that terminology in his own classroom. The shift not only allowed him to focus on the problems to which he was drawn, but directed his students’ attention to what he considered to be most salient in the context of the course. While the “long” eighteenth century remains one of many viable options, his example reminds us that the temporal and geographical frameworks should depend upon the research interests and learning goals.
            </p>
            <p>
                Many of the roundtable speakers also reaffirmed that thinking from our pedagogical sites activates the reciprocal processes of teaching and learning. Even though for her it was an old topic, Avcıoğlu approached the subject of turquerie anew as a result of the seminar she designed. Um learned to use Leaflet, a JavaScript Library for interactive web maps, so that she could simultaneously teach her graduate students and inform her own research. Experimentation within the classroom has the capacity to inform our research questions and methods.
            </p>
            <p>
                Conversely, if we engage students through an intentional and critical pedagogy, they become active participants in their own education. Cohen-Aponte encouraged us to respond to the fact that our students are more <a href="https://nces.ed.gov/programs/coe/indicator/cha">racially and ethnically diverse</a> racially and ethnically diverse than ever, and suggested that there is much to learn from the literature on pedagogy, even if it is largely targeted to K-12 educators. Approaching research and teaching as dialogical processes, as Arabindon-Kesson did while working with her students on the website, presents an opportunity to learn from the diverse, contemporary perspectives that students will inevitably bring to eighteenth-century material and to reconfigure the traditional structures of power within the academy.
            </p>
            <h4>Looking Forward</h4>
            <p>
                Even if it was not central to the episode they shared, each participant discussed using digital technology, whether that be PowerPoint or something more advanced. Nearly every educator had to make the leap when Zoom replaced their physical classroom during the COVID-19 pandemic. Online resources, including those from institutions such as the Open University that were already set up for distance learning, took on added importance. This difficult moment has, nonetheless, presented an opportunity moving forward to not just teach with digital technologies, but to embrace digital humanities. The term has been variously <a href="https://whatisdigitalhumanities.com/">defined</a> defined, but Um’s interactive mapping project offers a clear illustration. 
            </p>
            <p>
                While the establishment of so-called digital art history—as evidenced by recent publications, such as <a href="https://www.worldcat.org/title/routledge-companion-to-digital-humanities-and-art-history/oclc/1131873868&referer=brief_results"><i>The Routledge Companion to Digital Humanities and Art History</i></a> (2020); the founding of the <a href="https://digitalarthistorysociety.org/">Digital Art History Society</a>(DAHS) in 2018; and the success of the <a href="https://dahj.org/"><i>International Journal for Digital Art History</i></a>—offers exciting new directions for the field, for many, it brings more challenges for teaching. Questions about digital humanities naturally arose during the Q&A portion of the roundtable as just getting started can seem difficult. Yet, the reciprocal processes of teaching and learning are central to digital humanities pedagogy, just like any critical pedagogy. Um demonstrated how learning, and most importantly failing, alongside her students created meaningful learning opportunities for them. In other words, <a href="https://scholarslab.lib.virginia.edu/blog/digital-humanities-pedagogy-and-opportunities-for-hope/">DH pedagogy is pedagogy</a>, as <a href="https://scholarslab.lib.virginia.edu/people/brandon-walsh/">Brandon Walsh</a> has written. In fact, DH pedagogy does not even have to involve computers. It can be <a href="http://www.digitalhumanities.org/dhq/vol/5/3/000106/000106.html">unplugged</a> according to <a href="https://chass.ncsu.edu/people/pcfyfe/">Paul Fyfe</a>, which is a useful reframing particularly when working with student populations that have little or no access to digital technologies. 
            </p>
            <p>
                Thankfully, plenty of resources are now readily available. One helpful introduction is <a href="https://scholars.duke.edu/person/hannah.jacobs">Hannah Jacobs’</a> article for Art History Teaching Resources (AHTR), <a href="https://arthistoryteachingresources.org/2018/10/getting-started-with-digital-humanities-in-the-classroom/">“Getting Started with Digital Humanities in the Classroom”</a>. For practical advice and salient examples, Walsh highly recommends <a href="https://www.bloomsbury.com/uk/using-digital-humanities-in-the-classroom-9781350029750/"><i>Using Digital Humanities in the Classroom</i></a>and <a href="https://digitalpedagogy.hcommons.org/"><i>Digital Pedagogy in the Humanities</i></a>. Many universities in the United States now house DH centers, such as the <a href="https://scholarslab.lib.virginia.edu/">Scholars’ Lab</a> at the University of Virginia Library, where you can seek guidance and find potential collaborators. Duke University even has the dedicated <a href="https://dahvc.org/">Digital Art History & Visual Culture Research Lab</a>, which has developed great <a href="https://dahvc.org/resources/">resources</a>, including a bibliography and video tutorials. There are also the open-source storytelling tools developed by the <a href="https://knightlab.northwestern.edu/">Knight Lab</a> at Northwestern University that do not require knowledge of a programming language. As <a href="https://digitalcommons.salemstate.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1006&context=english_facpub">Roopika Risam</a> has written, we must still remain critical of the tools at our disposal, the majority of which were developed in the global north; and support the creation of new ones such as <a href="https://mukurtu.org/"> Mukurtu</a>, the community archive platform managed by the <a href="https://cdsc.libraries.wsu.edu/">Center for Digital Scholarship and Curation</a> at Washington State University that stemmed from a collaboration with members of the Indigenous Australian Warumungu community.</p>
            <p>
                Every participant in the roundtable also described different intellectual or physical moves that pushed beyond the boundaries of the traditional classroom. While digital humanities certainly encourage such mobility, these strategies also point to other critical approaches to teaching, such as antiracist and decolonial pedagogies. Barker recommended doing the necessary work by reading from the bibliographies listed on the Association for Art History’s <a href="https://forarthistory.org.uk/latest-news/resource-portal-on-anti-racism-and-decolonial-approaches-to-art-history-and-visual-culture-2/">Resource Portal on Anti-Racism and Decolonial Approaches to Art History and Visual Culture</a>. Since <a href="https://clas.osu.edu/sites/clas.osu.edu/files/Tuck and Yang 2012 Decolonization is not a metaphor.pdf"></a>decolonization is not a metaphor</a>, it must be accompanied by more profound structural changes to our curricula and classrooms; yet, we can still borrow from these pedagogies while working towards meaningful and comprehensive change.
            </p>
            <p>
                Cohen-Aponte’s initiative, “Pathways to Art History,” and the resulting community-driven project, is an exemplar to which we can look. It was highly collaborative, between Cohen-Aponte and her students as well as between her class and the staff of the Multicultural Resource Center, which opened a very different kind of pedagogical space. Um also described how using technology to collaborate with her students was a crucial vehicle for overturning the hierarchical knowledge transfer that has traditionally structured the academy. In addition to collaboration with and among students, co-teaching offers one possible solution to the challenge of working outside our own areas of expertise in the face of renewed debates around a global art history. Whiteman partnered with his colleague <a href="https://courtauld.ac.uk/people/sussan-babaie/">Sussan Babaie</a> to engage students from both courses on a collaborative project for which they produced trans-Asian histories of objects for potential publication on the web platform, <a href="https://thingsthattalk.net/en/">Things That Talk</a>. 
            </p>
            <p>
                As part of Cohen-Aponte’s partnership with the MRC, her class traveled to the community center and MRC staff, in turn, visited Cornell University. Each of the roundtable presentations involved a relocation of some kind, either to an interstitial university space, such as a library, university museum, or interdisciplinary lab; or beyond the walls of the university altogether, whether physically or virtually. Arabindon-Kesson and her students uncovered objects for the Art Hx database in various museums and archives, starting with those at Princeton University. Collaborating on real-world projects, such as the article Avcıoğlu’s seminar co-authored for Oxford Bibliographies Online, raises the stakes and provides invaluable learning opportunities.
            </p>
            <p>
                While travel was disrupted this year, technology allowed for the inclusion of voices that may not have otherwise been possible. Meier, for instance, invited multiple guest lecturers to her class via Zoom, such as Nancy Um and Athman Hussein Athman, Keeper of Heritage at the National Museums of Kenya, Mombasa. Barker and her colleagues successfully met the huge challenge posed by conceiving of a course taught entirely outside of a physical classroom. Sharing space, whether through collaborative teaching or guest speakers, decenters the single authoritative voice and invites the multiplicity and complexity brought by addition of more voices.
            </p>
            <p>
                This intellectual and physical mobility in and out of the classroom reflects the interconnected histories of the people and objects we both study and teach. Whiteman perfectly described the “long” eighteenth century in the context of his course on China as the, “the transition or liminal space between the early modern and the modern akin to the world of Foucault’s Don Quixote in which eras and epistemologies overlap and encounter one another, just as people and cultures do.” Perhaps, we can conceive of another trajectory, from a period that was once overlooked historiographically, due to its transitional status between the early modern and the modern, to one that has become a highly productive ground from which to teach art history because of that very liminality.
