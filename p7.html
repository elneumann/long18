            <h5 class="quote">A focus on the liminal or transitional space of the long eighteenth century encourages students to seek, in place itself, explanations for what they see in the materials and words of the period, and to tell stories of relation and connection rooted in the spatial and temporal local.</h5>

                    During 2020-2021, Stephen Whiteman taught his year-long, research-intensive MA course, "Beijing and Beyond: Art and Empire in Early Modern China," at the Courtauld Institute of Art, London. He also led a seminar for the interdisciplinary series, “What Makes the Early Modern?”, which every student in the so-called Early Modern period section takes in addition to their primary course of study. In both classrooms, he questioned how to situate the study of Chinese art in local and world historical time. The course focused on connected histories of art and architecture in and beyond the Chinese court in the early and high Qing period, or what was effectively the long eighteenth century. He partnered with his colleague <a href="https://courtauld.ac.uk/people/sussan-babaie/">Sussan Babaie</a> to engage students from both courses on a collaborative project for which they produced trans-Asian histories of objects for potential publication on the web platform, <a href="https://thingsthattalk.net/en/">"Things That Talk"</a>. In the seminar, he explored the particularities of local time by seeking both to undermine the hegemony of Eurocentric modernities and to question notions of regional modernities. As his teaching progressed, however, he found that shifting focus in his MA course from the broader Early Modern to the early and high Qing period, was productive for both he and his students. He characterized the period, in the context of his course, as a liminal space between the early modern and the modern periods in which eras and epistemologies overlap and encounter one another just like people and cultures. As a result, it provided a framework in which he could explore the intersecting problems of space, identity, ethnicity, and empire to which he was drawn, and his students could more successfully root their learning in China itself.
