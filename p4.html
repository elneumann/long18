            <h5 class="quote">We should think about who our students are generationally, particularly our undergraduate community, and how to continue adapting our teaching in ways that builds on their strengths and engages us in dialogical, generative, and creative relationships.</h5>

                    Cohe-Aponte launched the pilot program "Pathways to Art History" to help ensure that more students of color enter into the arts and humanities. She recognized that Generation Z is not only more <a href="https://nces.ed.gov/programs/coe/indicator/cha">racially and ethnically diverse</a>, but projected to be the most-well educated generation yet. That diversity in postsecondary education, however, is not reflected in the professoriate. While she has co-authored <a href="https://anandacohenaponte.files.wordpress.com/2019/08/cohen-aponte-and-fitzpatrick-sifford-addressing-diversity-and-inclusion.pdf">publications</a> around equity issues, she also wanted to address racial equity from the ground up at the high-school and early undergraduate levels. Cohen-Aponte was particularly inspired by recent scholarship on pedagogy, including Bettina Love's <a href="https://www.worldcat.org/title/we-want-to-do-more-than-survive-abolitionist-teaching-and-the-pursuit-of-educational-freedom/oclc/1100619452&referer=brief_results"><i>We Want to do More than Survive: Abolitionist Teaching and the Pursuit of Educational Freedom</i></a> (2020); as well as her engagement with online communities, such as the <a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/287885985584355/">"Decolonial and Anti-Racist Art Curriculum"</a> Facebook Group and the <a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/2396261667290772/">"Anti-Racist Art Educators"</a> Facebook Group. 
                </p>

                    In Spring 2019, she partnered with the <a href="http://www.multiculturalresourcecenter.org/">Multicultural Resource Center</a>, a nonprofit organization in Ithaca, NY, on a collaborative project for her undergraduate Latin American survey course at Cornell University. Students could choose from one of two tracks depending on their level of interest and schedules: write a standard paper and take an exam; or engage with the community-driven component. Working closely with MRC staff on an ongoing project that explores Black and Indigenous resistance movements,"The Resistance Cannot be Stopped," Cohen-Aponte’s students created a poster focused on Latin American and Latinx art. Additional contributions included a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLB6SXTYVvHa8DMOhUuIStpoPEup2EVwqE">YouTube Channel</a> with interviews, an educational packet for high-school teachers, and online classroom activities.

A scholar of the visual culture of colonial Latin America and the legacies of colonialism and contemporary Latinx art, she has been recognized for her efforts to create equity in the discipline of art history through the pilot project "Pathways to Art History."
