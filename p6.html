                    Nancy Um collaborated with her students on an interactive mapping project [link to PDF] as part of the graduate course, "Art/History in the Digital Age," that she taught at Binghamton University in Fall 2020. When determining which research and storytelling tools were necessary to teach emerging art historians, she focused on mapping as a critical exercise. Um had found that as her own work on the Indian Ocean continued to extend in scope, she needed to create her own maps to capture the movements of objects across widespread geographies, from the Red Sea Region to China and beyond. She learned to use Leaflet, a JavaScript Library for interactive web maps, with the programming language R in order to inform her own research and to teach her students. For the class, Um produced a video tutorial on Leaflet; and another on spreadsheets for humanities scholars with guidance on creating a dataset. Um concurrently created an 
                    <a href="http://indianoceanexchanges.com/pubs/map2.html">interactive map</a> as a companion to the presentation delivered with Meha Priyadarshin, "Four Objects on the Practice of Transoceanic Material Culture Studies"; and Alyssa Abesamis, an MA student in her course, produced another 
                    <a href="http://indianoceanexchanges.com/pubs/FINALPANMAP121420.html">map</a> that drew on data from the Public Art Network. Each student was required to produce their own map, or work together in groups to do so. They failed, iterated, and succeeded together in a dialogic process of teaching and learning. The exercise was aimed at expanding understandings of how art-historical narratives can be told with a commitment to working both visually and spatially. For Um, mapping introduced new geographical conceptions, new spatial ways to see the world and chronological divides differently, and introduced bracingly critical and collaborative pedagogical work.
